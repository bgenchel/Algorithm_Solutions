# Algorithm_Solutions
My solutions to various algorithm problems posed in my Algorithms course.

All classes are called 'Main' because of the grading conventions for the auto grader.

The Course is divided into sections that describe the premise of the knowledge used for the 
included algorithm problems. Each of those sections is divided into subsections whose titles 
offer further specificity.
